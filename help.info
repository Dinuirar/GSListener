HELP FOR LUSTRO-GSS SOFTWARE by Mikolaj Owczarzak 2018

This is a terminal for the LUSTRO BEXUS experiment. 
It allows the operator to set all of the experiment's 
configureable parametres, like motor's speed and measurements
frequency.

Available commands:

# operational:
stopm				Stop motors

go-idle			Turn off the motors and data gathering
status			Check experiment's status

go-scanning		Turn the scanning mode on
send-nth 			Send every N-th set of measurements to Ground Station
get-htp			Get humidity, temperature and pressure data
get-photo 			Get data from set of photodetectors
get-speed 			Get actual motor's speed
get-speed-fast		Display last motors' speeds set by set-speed command
get-uc-temp		Check the microcontroller's temperature

go-manual			enable additional commands, listed below
set-speed arg1 arg2	set selected (arg1 [1-2]) motor's speed (arg2 [0-255])
set-frequency arg	set measurements' frequency according to arg value
mknlog 			make new logfile on SD card
save-htp			Save humidity, temperature and pressure data on SD card

# networking:
set-ip arg			set destination's ip as arg and save it in configfile
set-port arg		set destination's targeted port as arg and save it in 
				configfile
set-address arg1 arg2	set destination's ip as arg1 and port as arg2 and save 
			them in configile
show-address		display current destination's ip and port from configfile
